# Go Fishing

This is based on the old Swedish Paradise fishing script for [FiveM™](https://fivem.net/).

Obviously, this is *not* for FiveM, but a freestanding project, using [Ebitengine™](https://ebitengine.org/).

## Graphics

Yes, this *looks* different from `paradise-fishing`. This is because I could not track down the original graphics I used, and while I'm pretty sure it was all CC0, I don't feel comfortable publishing it without first verifying that.

[Kenney to the rescue!](https://kenney.nl/assets/fish-pack)

Hopefully, I will manage to retail the *feel* of `paradise-fishing` with the new graphics.

## Not ready

This is not ready yet. Not even close. There is no gameplay, no documentation, no nothing.  I just threw together a [LICENSE](LICENSE.md) and a [README](README.md) really quick to do the *optional* crediting of Kenney for the graphics, since I did push the files.

## Plan

- [X] Basic environemnt rendering
- [ ] Prettier (animated?) enviroment
- [X] Water with waves
- [ ] Fish spawning
- [ ] Hook control
- [ ] Fish/hook intersect detection
- [ ] UI for number of fish caught and streak
- [ ] Saving streak record
